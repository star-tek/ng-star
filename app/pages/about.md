Roanoke's AngularJS and Javascript Meetup. We're focused on covering the latest frontend frameworks and 
web development practices. This group is for novices and ninjas. Our group is for the beginner playing around with 
javascript in their browser console and taking CodeSchool/Codecademy classes. Our group is the place to learn from 
the Designer and Javascript ninjas amazing users with a stellar UI, tweaking every pixel, and optimizing the 
pageload time.  We are focused on AngularJS for now, but we'd welcome presentations on other frameworks as well.
