# Learn Javascript and Rails

## Getting Started

> You're going to need a **[Github Account](https://github.com/).**

#### Learning to program:

- [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) - "Learn By Doing" - **can't recommend this one enough** for newbies.
- [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) - "Learn to code **interactively**, for free."
- [Code.org](http://code.org/) - Backed by **Bill Gates** and **Mark Zuckerberg**.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) - Learn tough algorithms from top colleges around the world, like **Stanford** and **Caltech** - for **Free!**
- The **Browser Console** - Open a browser and right-click on the page.  Select 'Inspect Element' and look for the Console.  
  Type some code.  You win.

#### Two mistakes that a lot of people make:

> **Don't** *start* with books, they're outdated. Even if they're a month old, they're outdated.  You're asking to be frustrated.    
>
> **Don't** *wait* for classes.  You can't learn to program nearly as well taking classes as you can by **diving in yourself!**  The earlier you start, the better.

#### Installing the Javascript tools of the trade:
- [Installing Bower](http://bower.io/) - A package manager for the frontend.  Manage frontend libraries and assets with ease.
- [Installing Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) - The Javascript Task Runner.  
- [Installing Lineman](http://linemanjs.com/) - A frontend framework built on top of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).  You'll need Node as well.
- [Installing Node](http://nodejs.org/) - NodeJS is used for frontend development tools and server-side javascript.

#### Pick a Frontend Framework

- [JQuery](http://jquery.com/) and [JQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) - considered oldschool by some, but sometimes simpler is better.  If you're new, learn this first.
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [AngularUI](http://angular-ui.github.io/) - backed by Google.
- [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) - developed Yehuda Katz, author of Bundler and Ruby Extraordinaire.
- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) - backed by Facebook.
- [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/) - a frontend framework.

 
#### Learn how to make a Plunker

If you're going to ask for help on IRC or post an issue on Github, it's unspoken code that you'll have a plunker 
 prepared.  A plunker is basically an example of the bug your seeing or the feature you want to implement.

- [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/) - A tool for collaborating on JS code
- [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/welcome/1/edit) - Collaborative JS Debugging
- [Ember JS Bin Template](http://emberjs.jsbin.com/) - A template JSBin for Ember

#### You'll need a Text Editor:

- [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - If you're new, this is what we recommend.
- [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) are more advanced users.
- [Nitrous.IO](https://www.nitrous.io/) - More than an IDE in the browser.  Highly recommended for new startups.  Hosts
  your development environment (Webserver, Database, Redis, etc) and allows you to collaboratively pair-program with 
  people across the globe.  This product is amazing.

## Getting Help

> **One of the most important things** you can do to
>
> learn programming faster is to **identify the tools** you'll use
>
> **when you get stuck**!  We cannot emphasize this enough!

#### You'll need to refer to: 
- The **Source Code**
- The **API Documentation**
- The **Stack Trace**

> And even then, sometimes you'll still be stuck.  You need to enjoy the challenges, but more importantly, you need to 
> **identify where to look for help**.  

#### Here's some ideas:
- Develop a network of people to ask
- Find a community that will expose you to new ideas
- Listen to podcasts and watch screencasts.  Make your own and give back!
- Find the repository on [Github](https://github.com)
- Chat on **IRC** & **Twitter** and talk to the authors

#### Here's some links for Javascript:

- [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/) - Angular Screencasts
- [EmberWatch](http://emberwatch.com/) - Ember Screencasts
- [Built With Angular](https://builtwith.angularjs.org/) - Angular projects

## Getting Better  

#### Here's some ideas for keeping your coding skills sharp.

- [Exercism.io](http://exercism.io/) - Coding exercises in multiple languages.  Created by Katrina Owens, a Ruby programmer.
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) - Compete with coding exercises against programmers all over the world.
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) - An oldie but a goodie.  Lots of great coding exercises.

#### Put your dotfiles online

Your [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/) are a collection of scripts you use for your environment.

#### Read these books

- [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://pragprog.com/book/tpp/the-pragmatic-programmer) - Andrew Hunt & Dave Thomas - a must read.
- [Refactoring](http://refactoring.com/) - Martin Fowler
